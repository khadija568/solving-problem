we creat functions:
1 function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.
2 function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of its cubes.
3 function that takes an array of non-negative integers and strings and return a new array without the strings.
4 function that takes a number as an argument and returns true or false depending
on whether the number is symmetrical or not. A number is symmetrical when it is the same as its reverse.
5 function that returns true if an array is special, and false otherwise.
6 function which returns the number of true values there are in an array.
7 function that converts an object into an array of keys and values.
8 function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.
9 function return true if the marathon is 25 miles long, otherwise, return false.
10 function that squares every digit of a number.
